# To Do App

This is a simple to-do application that I made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tanushchauhan/to-do-app.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd to-do-app
```

Open the index.html file in your favorite browser and enjoy!
